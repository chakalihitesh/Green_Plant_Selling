## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- `npm` (Node Package Manager)

### 1. Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

Open your terminal in the project directory and install all required standard and development dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can copy the structure from `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and configure the following variables:

```env
# Gemini AI Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

# Application URL
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Email Configuration (for OTP and order receipts)
SENDER_EMAIL="your_gmail_address@gmail.com"
APP_PASSWORD="your_gmail_app_password"

# Server Configuration
SERVER_PORT=3001
```

> **Note:** To get a Gmail App Password, ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google Account, then generate an App Password under Security settings.

### 3. Start the Backend Server (Express)

The backend handles email notifications, OTP verification, and AI requests.

Open a terminal window and run:
```bash
node server/index.js
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:3001` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### 4. Start the Frontend Application (Vite/React)

Open a **new** terminal window and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:5173` depending on your Vite configuration).
